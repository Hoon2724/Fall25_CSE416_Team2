# Campus Secondhand Marketplace (AI-Powered)

## Problem Statement
While existing secondhand platforms (e.g., Carrot, Bungaejangter) are widely used, they are not always suitable for the unique needs of a campus community. Our project addresses this gap with a dedicated **AI-powered marketplace for students**.  

### Problems & Our Solutions
1. **Trust and Safety**  
   - *Problem:* Open platforms make it difficult to verify user identity, leading to potential scams.  
   - *Solution:* By restricting sign-ups to school email addresses (e.g., `@sunykorea.ac.kr`), we ensure transactions occur only between verified students, creating a safer environment.  

2. **Convenient Trading Environment**  
   - *Problem:* Meeting strangers off-campus can be inconvenient and time-consuming.  
   - *Solution:* Our platform limits trading to campus and nearby areas, making meetups fast and practical. Trading activity can also align with the academic calendar (start/end of semester).  

3. **Student-Specific Items**  
   - *Problem:* On large platforms, it is difficult to filter for student-related items like textbooks, dorm supplies, or lab equipment.  
   - *Solution:* Our marketplace focuses on categories tailored to students’ needs: textbooks, notes, electronics, dorm essentials, and more.  

4. **Community Building**  
   - *Problem:* General marketplaces lack opportunities for fostering connections within the student body.  
   - *Solution:* Peer-to-peer trading strengthens community ties, helping freshmen, exchange students, and graduating seniors connect while exchanging useful items.  

## AI Integration
Our project differentiates itself by embedding **AI-powered features** to enhance usability and security:  
- **Smart Recommendations:** Personalized suggestions based on user preferences and browsing history.  
- **Automatic Categorization:** Upload an image and the AI classifies it (e.g., "textbook", "electronics", "furniture").  


By combining a **student-focused environment** with **AI enhancements**, our platform provides a safe, efficient, and user-friendly way for students to buy, sell, and exchange items within their campus.
